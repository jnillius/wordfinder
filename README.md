# WordFinder
I plan on creating this tool to help me create crypticles. I often find that I need a word with very specific requirements, like for example: being 7 letters long, starting/ending with letters 'ab', containing letters 'x' 'y' and 'z', containing the subword 'gma', having a 'j' on the 3rd position or being a adjective. Hopefully this tool can help me find those words.

# Datasource
Right now I have taken the words.txt file from ´https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt´.

# How vibecoded is this?
Very.

# TODO:
* add better rescriptions/placeholders for the filter fields.
